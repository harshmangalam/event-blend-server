## Docker Support

This project now includes Docker support for easy setup and deployment, using Bun instead of Node.js.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/harshmangalam/eventblend-api.git
   cd eventblend-api
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Stopping the Docker containers

To stop the running containers, use:
```
docker-compose down
```

To stop the containers and remove the volumes (this will delete the database data), use:
```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Running Prisma migrations

After starting the containers, you may need to run Prisma migrations. You can do this with:
```
docker-compose exec event-blend-server bun run prisma migrate deploy
```

### Accessing the database

To access the PostgreSQL database directly, you can use:
```
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d eventblend
```

### Viewing logs

To view the logs of the event-blend-server:
```
docker-compose logs event-blend-server
```

For real-time logs:
```
docker-compose logs -f event-blend-server
